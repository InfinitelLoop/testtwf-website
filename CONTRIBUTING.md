Documentation is currently built using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which itself relies on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This automatically transforms the content of this repository into a [static website hosted on GitHub](http://w3c.github.com/ttwf-docs/). We'll have a cusom domain pointing ot it shortly.

Documentation should be written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). It will be transformed into HTML during the build process.

Contributions should follow the standard open source GitHub workflow (fork the repository, work off topic-branches, send atomic commits as pull requests, and get them reviewed by a peer).

Generally, contributing to a doc will imply:

1. commenting on the issue to announce you're plannin to work on it,
2. looking at [existing docs](https://github.com/w3c/ttwf-docs/blob/gh-pages/RESOURCES.md) to find related content,
3. using an [online service](http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/) to convert that content to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
4. copyediting it,
5. adding [YAML front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/),
6. signing the [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.clahub.com/agreements/w3c/testing-doc), and
7. sending a pull request.

Thanks for your help!
