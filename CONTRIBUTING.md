Contributions follow the standard open source GitHub workflow (fork the repository, work off topic-branches, send atomic commits as pull requests, and get them reviewed by a peer).

To get started, sign the [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.clahub.com/agreements/w3c/testing-doc).

Documentation is currently built using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which itself relies on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This automatically transforms the content of this repository into a [static website hosted on GitHub](http://w3c.github.com/ttwf-docs/).

Documentation should be written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). It will be transformed into HTML during the build process. Note that existing HTML documents can be easily converted to markdown using an [online service](http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/).
