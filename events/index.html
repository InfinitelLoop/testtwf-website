<p class=lead>
  One of the intentions of the Test the Web Forward movement is to get you more involved
  in testing the Web platform. We've organized a number of hackathons that will help you
  get there and more are being planned! Representatives from W3C, browser vendors, and
  working groups will be on hand to guide you.
</p>

<p>
  During these hackathons, you will discover new web features and learn how to write tests
  that will help browsers vendors build better and more interoperable implementations.
</p>

<p>
  Experts will be on hand to help you write tests for W3C specifications in several areas
  as well as guide you through filing bug reports. You will learn new web features and
  recommended practices that will be useful in projects you contribute to in the future!
