<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  The main goal of the Test the Web Forward movement is to get you more involved
  in testing the Web platform to ensure better interoperability on the Web. One of the ways we 
  do this is through a series of hackathons and meetups where we bring the community together,
  educate, and share expertise. Attending a Test the Web Forward event 
  is a great opportunity to discover new web features and learn how to write tests that will 
  help browsers vendors build better and more interoperable implementations.
</p>

<p>
  At the hackathons, experts from the W3C and all of the major browser vendors are always on hand to 
  help you write tests for W3C specifications in several areas as well as guide you through filing 
  bug reports. You will learn new web features and recommended practices that will be useful in projects 
  you contribute to in the future!
</p>

<h2 id="host">Host Your Own Event</h2>

<p>
 Test the Web Forward is a grass roots community-driven movement which means it belongs to everyone - 
 including you! We're actively looking for passionate Web community leaders to help
 carry the movement forward. If you're a part of a web-related user group or
 belong to an organization that wants to Make the Web a Better Place, consider hosting an event of 
 your own or partnering with others in your area to put one on.
</p>
<p>
 If you'd like to plan larger hackathon event, we have a comprehensive Event Kit full of resources and 
 information that can help you every step of the way.  
 {% include cta.html body="Get started with the Event Kit" icon="briefcase" url="/events/kits/event-kit.html" %} 
</p>

<p>
 If you don't have the time or resource to plan a large hackathon, consider small meetup event where you can bring
 a small group of people together to share information about testing the web or even take on a small one-evening 
 hacking project! For this, or we can point you in the right direction as well. We've created Meetup Kit to get you 
 started with ideas and planning.
 {% include cta.html body="Get started with the Meetup Kit" icon="wallet" url="/events/kits/meetup-kit.html" %} 
</p>

<p>
For either type of event, we recommend you kick it off by mailing 
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-testtwf-planning/">public-testtwf-planning@w3.org</a> 
to see if others in your area would be interested in joining you to host, partner, or sponsor your event.
