# Test the Web Forward Event Kit

<h2 id="getting_started">Getting Started</h2>
If you have hosted any event in the past, you know that hosting a <em>successful</em>
event takes a lot of time, effort and coordination.  Planning in advance is critical as is follow up after the event, 
so be sure to allocate sufficient lead time and overall time.

We recommend that you subscribe to the general [pubic-testtwf][public-testtwf] mailing list so that you will always stay updated on past and future events.

<h2 id="initial_planning">Initial Planning</h2>
We recommend that you start <strong>THREE</strong> months prior to your target date.  You may be able to be successful in a shorter amount of time with more support but it will be much more stressful. 

### Determine the Details

The best way to sketch out your event is to start with answering the following questions. You can then start your planning process based on your answers to them. We've included some templates and materials [below][templates] that can help in this process.

1. What are the goals of your event?  Educational?  Number of tests contributed?  Number of tests cases reviewed? Awareness of the movement?  Something else?
2. Is there a reasonable expectation that there will be experts available to help out at the event? For example, is there a W3C working group meeting in the same place/dates?
3. Assuming there is a W3C event, is there a reasonable assumption that working group members or others will be available and willing to be experts for the Test the Web Forward Event you are hosting?
4. Are there are any conflicting events or holidays? Be sure to look at local user group events, lanyard, meetup, etc. Also, do look at the W3C events calendar.
5. Identifying and talking to local user groups is critical.  They will likely be able to help spread the message of the movement and publicize the event.  Additionally, they may want to be involved in some manner (sponsor, speaker, experts, venue, etc).
6. Is there enough of an audience to support the event? Is there a large enough base of web developers?  Are there local HTML, JS, CSS user groups?
7. Is there a suitable venue in a central location or reasonable potential of finding one?
8. Will your presentations and other content be in English or some other language?  Are the speakers capable of presenting in that language?
9. Do you need real time translation for the presentation? Ad hoc translation for the hacking part?
10. Does any content and/or the website need to be localized?
11. Do you have people you can rely on to help organize?
12. Do you need monetary or in kind sponsorship?
13. If you need sponsorship, do you have leads on potential sponsors and a reasonable expectation of getting the potential sponsors to commit?
